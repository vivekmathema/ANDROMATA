2D Cellular Automata (AndroMATA) Pro v0.1

Introduction
Cellular Automata is a mathematical modeling concept used for studying growth characteristics, particle automata, homogeneous structures, cancer growth, cellular structures, and pseudo-random arrays. The entity denoted as cells are organized in a grid, such that each cell changes state as a function of time according to a defined set of rules that includes the states of neighboring cells. Cellular automata have been suggested for generation of public key cryptography and are widely used for creating pseudo-random numbers and sequences.
Itâ€™s a great and useful tool if you are a computerphile or numberphile. In addition, the software and exported data from the simulation helps you to discover and derive your own conclusions based the output data using different parameters. You will be amazed how complex the simple structures can get over time based on pre-defined simple set of rules.
